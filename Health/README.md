# Health Retrieval System
This is a retreival system that you can do anything with it. In order to work with this system you need to start an react app for frontend and a django app for backend.
This project consists of 3 parts. Frontend, Backend, and Development. Development is mainly consists of notebooks that we train our models based on them.
